recipeinstructions:

- "In a stand mixer or a large bowl add butter, sugars and vanilla and mix until fully combined."
- "Slowly add your dry ingredients to the butter mixture (1/3 of the mix at a time) and mix until just incorporated. At this point your dough will be a little crumbly, do not worry, it will come together in the next step!"

- "Fold in chocolate chunks (or chips) and chopped hazelnuts until evenly dispersed in the mixture."
- "Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, scoop your dough into balls and place on the baking tray. Don&#39;t worry about spreading them out, they aren&#39;t going in the oven yet."
- "Place tray in the fridge for 30 minutes - 1 hour to allow the dough to hydrate."
- "Before removing the dough from the fridge, preheat your oven to 180C/350F and line 2 more baking trays."
- "When dough has chilled in the fridge, transfer dough balls to the trays and leave enough room in between each one to allow room for spreading."
- "Bake for 8-11 minutes or until golden brown, when removed from the oven the cookies will be soft and look under-baked so do not remove tray or touch."
- "Let cookies cool for 10-15 minutes on the baking tray and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely, if you wish."
