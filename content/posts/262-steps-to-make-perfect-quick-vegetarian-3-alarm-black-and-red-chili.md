recipeingredient:
- "3 tbsp corn oil"
- "2 small onions diced"
- "2 large jalapenos minced with seeds"
- "1 tsp dried Mexican oregano crumbled"
- "1 tbsp epazote heaping and crumbled"
- "1/2 tsp chipotle ground"
- "1/2 tsp ancho chile powder"
- "1 bhut jolokia minced with seeds"
- "1 1/2 tbsp salt"
- "10 oz textured vegetable protein TVP"
- "1/4 cup soy sauce"
- "28 oz crushed tomato"
- "18 oz tomato paste"
- "3 can cooked black beans 1lb 13oz cans"
- "2 tbsp peanut butter super crunchy no sugar added and heaping"
- "4 cup water"
- "1/2 cup cream"
- "1 handful cilantro chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oil on low heat in an 8qt pot, and toss in the onions and jalapenos."
- "Add the oregano, epazote, chipotle, ancho, salt, and the bhut jolokia, and stir and simmer a few minutes."
- "A note on the bhut jolokia. That little dried bhut jolokia, or ghost chili, raises the alarms from about 1 to 3. So, if you are faint of heart, you may want to skip the bhut."
- "Add the TVP, the soy sauce, and all of the tomato ingredients, and stir the lumps of tomato out."
- "Now add the beans and peanut butter. Remember, you want the natural peanut butter, not the one with partially hydrogenated oils and sugar added. Stir well to incorporate the peanut butter."
- "Now add the water and cream and stir intermittently about 5 minutes until the TVP has absorbed all it can."
- "For the finish, add in the cilantro, salt to taste, and serve."
- "A couple of notes: First, you may find yourself adding a notable amount of salt to get the flavor to your liking. Most commercial chili is pretty salty. Second, the chili, as pictured, is fresh made, but chili is always better and thicker the second day."
