recipeingredient:
- "4 Taco Boat Shells"
- "2 Bell Peppers"
- "1 Can Red Kidney Beans"
- "1 Large Onion"
- "3 Cloves Garlic"
- "100 g Smoked Seitan Wheat Gluten"
- "1 Lime"
- "150-200 ml Tomato Sauce"
- "30-50 ml Tomato Paste"
- " Soy Sauce"
- " Balsamic Vinegar"
- " Olive Oil"
- " Herbs and Spices"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preparation: Pre-heat your oven to 200 C (392 F). Dice the onion and garlic cloves and drizzle them with balsamic vinegar. Slice the seitan into cubes and drizzle with soy sauce. Thoroughly wash the beans and put them in a bowl. Add the tomato sauce and paste to the beans, as well as herbs and spices (I used: salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, chives, oregano, rosemary, turmeric, a dash of ginger powder) and mix it all together."
- "Flame-roasted bell peppers: Wash the bell peppers thoroughly and dry them. Turn a burner to the highest setting and carefully place the bell pepper on top of it. After a while, turn the bell pepper over to char the other side as well. If you don&#39;t have a gas stove, you can roast the bell peppers in a pan (with no oil)."
- "When you&#39;re done, let the bell peppers cool. Use a knife to scrape off the charred parts from the bell pepper (don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get all of it off). Slice the bell peppers into medium-thin strips (see photo)."
- "The chili: Coat a frying pan with olive oil and heat it up. Add the chopped onion and garlic. After only 2-3 minutes, add the seitan cubes as well. Fry over high heat for 2-3 minutes. Add the bean and tomato sauce mix from before to the pan, as well as the bell pepper strips. Turn the heat down to medium and let simmer for 7-10 minutes while occasionally stirring."
- "Taco boats: While the chili is cooking, put the taco boat shells in the oven and bake for 5 minutes or until crispy."
- "Serving: Fill the taco boat shells with the chili and decorate with chives, fresh parsley/coriander, or grated cheese. Cut the lime into half and serve next to the dish. Enjoy your meal! ðŸ™‚"
