Pizza Roses - Step by Step - Fauzia&#39;s Kitchen Fun. For the dough, I used my basic pizza dough.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pizza Roses:

1. Get  Pepperoni (at least 60 slices)
1. Make ready 1 tube Pillsbury Buttery Flake Crescents Dough (8 rolls worth)
1. Prepare 6 teaspoons Marinara Sauce
1. Make ready 3 oz Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
1. Prepare  Little bit of Oregano


Tandoor Grilled Chicken, Onion, Jalapeno or Bell Pepper &amp; fresh Cilantro. Loaded with Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Onions, Broccoli &amp; Olives. Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the pan. I suggest putting more cheese, not adding loads of sauce, and rolling it tight so the rose won&#39;t get ruined in the oven when cooking.
