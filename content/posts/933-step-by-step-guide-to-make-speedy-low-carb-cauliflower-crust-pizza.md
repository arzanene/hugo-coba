recipeinstructions:
- "Divide the cauliflower into florets and discard the outer leaves and the core. Place in a food processor and blitz briefly until shredded into couscous size grains. You might need to do this in two batches."
- "The recipe I was following said to place the cauliflower rice in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 5-6 minutes on high. I don&#39;t have a microwave and found another recipe where it suggested spreading thinly in a large roasting pan, rubbing in a little olive oil, and baking for 10 minutes at 200C/Gas 6. It caught slightly so I&#39;d suggest a lower heat for about 6-8 minutes."
- "Pile the cooked cauliflower rice in the middle of a clean kitchen towel and squeeze it tightly so that all the liquid is removed. All the recipes I looked at stressed that this is really important to get a dry pizza base. I think microwaving probably creates more liquid as I didn&#39;t get that much."
- "Place the &#39;rice&#39; in a bowl and add the ground almonds, eggs, oregano and cheese. Season with salt and pepper and mix well."
- "Place baking parchment on a baking tray and brush liberally with olive oil. Pile the pizza base mixture in the middle and then use your fingers to spread it out into a thin round."
- "Bake in the hot oven for 15 minutes until golden."
- "Allow to cool completely, then add your pizza toppings. I used some leftover tomato and bacon sauce I&#39;d made for pasta and some grated Cheddar cheese and Parmesan. Place in the oven and cook for 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbling. Eat!"
