recipeingredient:
- " The dough"
- "400 g flour"
- "225 ml water"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp granulated sugar"
- "7 g sachet of instant dried yeast"
- " Tomato sauce"
- "200 ml tinned tomatoes"
- "1 tsp basil"
- "1/2 tsp parsley"
- "1/2 tsp oregano"
- "1/2 tsp garlic granules"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- " Grind of pepper"
- "Squeeze tomato paste for added richness optional"
- " Toppings"
- " Lowmoisture mozzarella"
- " Grated cheddar optional"
- " Pepperoni optional"
- " Anything else that youd like on top"
recipeinstructions:
- "It sounds like the wrong place to start, but, trust me, it&#39;s not. You need to cut up any toppings and refrigerate them, don&#39;t grate the cheese yet though, it&#39;ll clump. So any pepper, onions, mushrooms etc... Should be cut now."
- "Make the tomato sauce. This is very simple, you need to put everything in a bowl and then blend it with a handheld blender or in an actual blender until smooth."
- "When you think you want to eat soon, start making the dough. This can take around 20 minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to fan 220 with a pizza stone, pizza steel or a nothing if you don&#39;t have one."
- "Sift the flour into the bowl and then add the yeast, salt and sugar. Whisk until combined."
- "Make a well in the centre and pour in the olive oil and water. Mix with a wooden spoon until it has come together and then knead for 5 minutes on a floured surface or until silky."
- "Place in the fridge whilst you get your toppings out. You don&#39;t want it to prove in the fridge because you will get a fluffy crust if you do. I like thin and crispy, but if you like fluffy then leave it there overnight."
- "(FOR A FLUFFY CRUST) Take the dough out of the fridge and knock it back. Shape it and then do the next step."
- "Shape the dough and put it on the hot pizza steel/ stone. Lather it with a generous portion of tomato sauce. This won&#39;t make the crust soggy, because it has already started to crisp up on the pizza steel."
- "Sprinkle on the cheeses and then add your pepperoni or toppings. Cook for 15 minutes."
- "Optional step: If you really enjoy that gooey cheese but crispy crust, then slice some balls of mozzarella and place it on top of the pizza when it&#39;s done. Change the oven to a grill setting and just leave it under there until melted and slightly browned. Enjoy!"
