recipeingredient:
- "2 bananas"
- "1.5 cup plain flour"
- "0.5 cup sugar"
- "0.5 cup nut milk"
- "0.25 cup oil"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "0.25 tsp salt"
- " For chocolate ones add"
- "3 tbsp cocoa powder"
- "100 g dark chocolate 1 bar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mash bananas with a fork in a large bowl"
- "If you&#39;re making chocolate muffins, smash the chocolate bar into pieces with a mallet. Remove the foil first. It is easier when frozen and the bar is thin (Lindt chocolate)."
- "Preheat the oven for 180°C/356°C"
- "Add all the dry ingredients to the bowl (chocolate pieces, flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt) and give it a mix. The baking soda needs to spread evenly through the mixture to not get activated by moisture."
- "Add all the liquid ingredients (milk, oil)"
- "Mix all with a large wooden spoon. You will use it to fill the moulds later."
- "Prepare muffin moulds on a baking tray. I use silicone ones from IKEA as they are reusable, you can fit all on one tray and don&#39;t need a special tray. But you can also use waxed paper moulds on a flat tray OR regular paper moulds in a muffin tray. If you have only regular paper moulds and flat tray, use two moulds for one muffin."
- "Fill the moulds to roughly 75% each. The muffins will grow!"
- "Bake on 180°C/356°C for 20-30 minutes."
- "Use a skewer to check if the muffins are done. Pierce a few of the muffins in the middle and if there is no dough left on the skewer, they are done."
