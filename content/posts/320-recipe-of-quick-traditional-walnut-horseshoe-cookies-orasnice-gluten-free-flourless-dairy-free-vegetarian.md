recipeingredient:
- "3 eggs egg whites only"
- "100 g finely chopped walnuts"
- "250 g ground walnuts"
- "1/2 small lemon  juice only"
- "100 g walnut or almond flour finely ground  you may need less or a bit more depending on size of the eggs and lemon"
- "250 g sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Separate egg whites from yolks. Whisk the egg whites with a mixer or fork until they are foamy and the foam is fluffy and firm."
- "Slowly add sugar while whisking and whisk until it has blended with the egg whites. Here they used brown sugar."
- "Add ground walnuts and mix with a spatula. If the consistency is too runny, add more ground walnuts or ground almonds until the mix is like a dough and can be easily made into small sausage-like logs"
- "Take a ball of the mixture and make into a sausage - you can make them bigger or smaller, to taste. If your hands get to sticky to work with the mix, dip them in the bowl of water you prepared."
- "Roll the cookie sausage in finely chopped walnuts until covered at all sides. Shape into a horseshoe and lay on baking paper in the baking pan or cookie sheet."
- "Turn on the oven to 200C. Once the oven has reached the temperature, lower to 100c and put the baking tray in the oven, uncovered for 15-20’. The cookies are more drying than baking."
- "After 15’, check take a knife and tap on the cookies. The cookies should have a harder putter crust where knife doesn’t leave a mark but not be so dried out that the inside has dried up - it should remain soft and chewy. If it looks like it needs more time, add time in the overly at 3-5’ increments checking frequently until consistency is just right."
- "Lay out to cool and further dry - they can be left out at room temperature and served over the next few days. If they are not covered (eg in a cookie tin) they will further dry out - still tasty but will lose the chewiness."
