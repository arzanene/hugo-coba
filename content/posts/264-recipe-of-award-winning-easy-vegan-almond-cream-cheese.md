##### The ingredients needed to make Easy! Vegan Almond Cream Cheese:

1. Prepare 1 approx. 50 grams Raw sliced almonds

It uses only five ingredients: raw almonds, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and water. But if you want a vegan, lactose-free, dairy-free substitution that&#39;s similar to cheese, then this slightly sweet, tangy and creamy almond cheese is for. It&#39;s also great for when I&#39;m having no luck with culturing my cashew cream cheese-which, by the way, seems to be a regular occurrence for me since moving to DC (anyone have any insight as to why DC hates my culturing attempts?). Are you looking for a quick and tasty vegan cream cheese recipe that only takes minutes to make.
