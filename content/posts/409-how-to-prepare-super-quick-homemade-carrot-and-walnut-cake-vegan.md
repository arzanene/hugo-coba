I don&#39;t really enjoy mix-ins in my carrot cake. I much prefer to add ingredients like walnuts in-between layers or as decorations. Carrot cake is not complete without the cream cheese frosting, so of course, it&#39;s also topped with a rich layer of just that. However, if you don&#39;t have access to vegan cream cheese then you can make your own or use whipped coconut cream.
