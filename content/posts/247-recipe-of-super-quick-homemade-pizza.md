recipeingredient:
- " Dough"
- "3 cups allpurpose flour"
- " water"
- "8 gr yeast"
- " olive oil"
- "1 teaspoon sugar"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- " Sauce"
- "1 cup condensed tomato sauce"
- " oregano"
- " basil"
- "1 teaspoon sugar"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- " olive oil"
- " Topping"
- "1/2 cheese of your preference"
- "15 turkey slices"
- " bacon"
- " 1 tomato"
- " mushrooms"
- " 1 green pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Get a bowl and pour the flour. Add about ten-fifteen tablespoons of olive oil."
- "Fill a cup with warm water (not hot) and pour in the yeast, one teaspoon salt and one teaspoon sugar. Stir with a teaspoon until the yeast melts and pour the water in the flour."
- "With your hand, combine the ingredients and knead the dough. (if flour or water is needed, add some)"
- "Let the dough rest in the bowl for at least half an hour with a towel on top of it (in a warm place)."
- "In another bowl pour the tomato sauce, some oregano and basil, the other teaspoon of sugar and salt and some olive oil (about five tablespoons). Mix and set aside."
- "Now, the ingredients you&#39;ll need apart from the cheese and the turkey, depend on you. All of them need to be cut into slices, not too thick as to be baked and not too thin as their taste will not be distinguished."
- "Once the dough has doubled in size, you pour some oil in a round tray and spread it with your fingers (or a brush). You put the dough in it and start opening it with your hands until it covers all the tray."
- "The size of the tray is up to you to decide. In a smaller one, the crust will be deep, whereas in a bigger one thinner. I prefer the deep crust, so I choose a small tray and also I make the dough higher where the sides of the tray are. In this way I make sure the sauce won&#39;t slide out of the dough and be burnt on the tray and also get a tart kind of pizza."
- "You set the oven to 180° Celsius on air and you start preparing your pizza."
- "Pour some of the sauce on the dough. Then a very thin layer of cheese. Cut with your hands into small pieces the ten slices of the turkey and spread them on top of the cheese."
- "Pour some sauce, then a more thick layer of cheese, the other five slices of turkey and on top of that all the other ingredients that you chose (starting by tomatoes)."
- "After you put all of the ingredients, cover the whole pizza with the remaining cheese and pour onto it the rest of the sauce."
- "Bake for 35-40 minutes in the middle of the oven and if you reckon some more time is needed for the fluids to be stabilized, place the pizza for another 5-10 minutes on the lowest part of the oven."
