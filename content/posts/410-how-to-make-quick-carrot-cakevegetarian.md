For this vegan carrot cake, you&#39;ll need two mixing bowls and cake pan(s). In the first bowl, mix together the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In the second bowl, whisk together the egg replacer (more on that later) and water, oil, vanilla, crushed pineapple, and finely shredded carrots. This super easy vegan carrot cake is made with cinnamon applesauce to keep it nice and moist, which means that you don&#39;t need an egg-replacer or an egg substitute at all. While this does keep it simple and makes it virtually foolproof (and a great vegan cake recipe for new vegans or anyone new to baking to try), it also means that this carrot cake isn&#39;t super light and fluffy. 

So that's going to wrap it up with this exceptional food carrot cake(vegetarian) recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I'm confident you will make this at home.
