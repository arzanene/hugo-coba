recipeingredient:
- "1 cup apple cider"
- "3/4 cup finely diced apple"
- "2 tablespoons coconut oil"
- "1 flax egg 1 tablespoon ground flaxmeal  3 tablespoons water"
- "1/3 cup dark brown sugar"
- "1/4 cup unsweetened Almond milk"
- "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
- "1 cup white whole wheat flour or allpurpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg"
- "1/8 teaspoon ground ginger"
- "Pinch ground cloves"
- " For a cinnamon  sugar topping"
- "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
recipeinstructions:
- "To a small saucepan over medium-high heat, add the apple cider and apples. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 2/3 cup total, about 10 minutes."
- "Pour the apple mixture into a medium, heat-proof mixing bowl and add the coconut oil to help it melt. Cool until lukewarm, about 20 minutes."
- "About 5 minutes before proceeding with the doughnut batter, make the flax egg and preheat the oven. To make the flax egg, mix the flaxmeal and water in a small bowl. It will need to sit for 5-10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Prepare a doughnut pan by spraying with nonstick spray, an oil mister, or lightly greasing the cups with coconut oil. Set aside."
- "When the apple mixture has cooled enough to proceed, add the flax egg, brown sugar, almond milk, and vanilla extract. Stir to combine."
- "To a large mixing bowl, add the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. Stir with a whisk to combine. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir again, just until combined."
- "Spoon the batter into the cups of the doughnut pan, or scoop the batter into a gallon-size zipper bag, snip off the end, and pipe it into the pan. Fill the cups 2/3 full, dividing the batter evenly between all the cups."
- "Bake until the tops spring back when you poke them, 10-12 minutes."
- "Remove from oven. Cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes then carefully transfer the doughnuts to a wire rack. But don’t walk away just yet! You’ll want to dip the doughnuts in the cinnamon-sugar mix while they’re still warm. Mix together the cinnamon-sugar topping by combining the sugar and cinnamon in a large zipper bag. One by one, gently place the still-warm doughnuts in the bag with the cinnamon sugar and very carefully toss the doughnut in the sugar mix until coated. Place back on the wire rack."
- "Donuts keep well at room temperature in a semi-airtight container for 2-3 days (I store them in a glass cookie jar.)"
