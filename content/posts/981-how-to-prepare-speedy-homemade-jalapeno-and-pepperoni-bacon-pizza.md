recipeinstructions:
- "First oil up your baking dish and gently form your pizza dough into it. Once it&#39;s roughly the shape you want it, leave it covered while you preheat your oven to 450 degrees for about a half hour."
- "While the oven is warming up, prepare bacon by placing slices between paper towel on a microwave safe dish and microwave for 2-3 minutes. Let cool, cut into small strips and set aside for later."
- "While preparing jalapeños I recommend wearing gloves as the juices will burn your hands a bit. Slice up jalapeños and microwave in between paper towel sheets for 1 minute to get out most of the moisture. Repeat process with pepperoni."
- "Assemble the pizza by putting cheese down first, pressing it down so it fuses with the dough while cooking. Add your sauce evenly over top, arrange all of your toppings on the sauce. Add your parmesan cheese over the toppings."
- "Cook pizza in the oven at 450 degrees for 25 minutes for a perfect doneness (leave in for 30-35 minutes for a well done crust) let it rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting into and enjoy!"
