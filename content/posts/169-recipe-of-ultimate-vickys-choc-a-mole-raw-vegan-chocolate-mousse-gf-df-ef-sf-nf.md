recipeingredient:
- "2 large ripe avocados"
- "60 grams unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "120 ml agave nectar or to taste"
- "1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- " some coconut cream to thin and mellow to your own taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Halve the avocados and remove stones. Scoop out flesh and chop roughly"
- "Add to a blender with the rest of the ingredients except for the cream"
- "Pulse blend, scraping down the sides as required to get all the avocado chunks smooth"
- "If your avocado isn&#39;t quite soft enough drizzle a little of the milk in to help it get going. Taste and add milk as needed but don&#39;t use so much to make the mousse too wet or it won&#39;t set"
- "Mix some coconut cream in to adjust the consistency and flavour and whip up. Pour into serving glasses / ramekins and chill in fridge for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight"
- "You can flavour this mousse any way you want. In the past I&#39;ve used fresh orange juice instead of milk to get the blender moving and omitted the vanilla. I&#39;ve also done mint chocolate using a tsp of mint essence. You can add banana to it, lots of options. And no one would guess this decadant dessert has avocado in it, it&#39;s just gorgeous!"
