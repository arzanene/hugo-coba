Brenda&#39;s Jalapeno Popper Pizzas is something which I have loved my entire life. They are fine and they look wonderful.

This was the BEST jalapeno popper pizza recipe that I have ever made or tried! I used Sherri &#39;s personal recipe &#39;Basic Pizza Dough&#39; for the crust and stuffed the crust w/ mozzarella for extra cheesy goodness. Jalapeño Popper Pizza - All the flavors of a cheesy jalapeño popper is so much better in pizza form, with added bacon of course! And better than a traditional jalapeño popper in my opinion.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have brenda&#39;s jalapeno popper pizzas using 7 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

Jalapeno Popper filled wonton cups is an easy and yummy wonton appetizer! Creamy, cheesy, spicy and crispy, they are the perfect appetizer! Jalapeno popper wonton cups can be made in advance but I don&#39;t usually fill and bake them until serving. If you want the jalapenos to be less spicy, make sure you remove the seeds and membrane when you&#39;re chopping them.
