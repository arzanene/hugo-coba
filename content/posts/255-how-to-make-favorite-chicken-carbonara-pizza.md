I have a deep love for classic spaghetti carbonara, the Roman dish of spaghetti tossed with crispy pork, lots of pecorino cheese, and a luxe egg sauce. I&#39;m shamefully addicted to the chicken alfredo breadbowls. I prefer them over the pizzas and they&#39;re any other type of pasta from Domino&#39;s and didn&#39;t plan to, but today I noticed the chicken carbonara.
