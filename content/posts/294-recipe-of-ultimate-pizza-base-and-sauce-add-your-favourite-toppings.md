- "Knead the dough on a floured surface about 10 minutes or about 5 with kitchenaid."
- "Place it into a bowl, drizzle it with olive oil and leave to rise in a warm place for about 30min or until it doubles in size."
- "For the pizza sauce put everything to a blender and blitz it together until smooth."
- "Now the dough itâ€™s ready cut to size and stretch into pizza shape."
- "Spread the pizza sauce on the base and add your favourite toppings. This recipe is a margarita pizza with added courgette on the top. I used the cheap version of grated mozzarella which perfect to get that super stringy cheese. Bake your pizza on 250 degrees Celsius for about 12 minutes. Best to put the dough on the pre heated tray."
