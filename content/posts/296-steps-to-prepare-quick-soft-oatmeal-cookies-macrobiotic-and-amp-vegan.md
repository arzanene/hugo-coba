recipeinstructions:
- "Mix together all of the ingredients until no longer floury. Use a spoon or ice cream scoop to place 10 scoops of dough onto a baking pan. They don&#39;t expand upon baking, so create your desired thickness by pressing down on them from the top."
- "Bake in the oven at 190℃ for 18 minutes. Be careful not to burn the bottoms."
- "Once they&#39;ve baked, leave them on the baking tray for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a rack. This will make them soft. They&#39;re even softer the next day."
- "Using baking soda instead of baking powder makes them even softer. Use about half a teaspoon. These are also delicious with almonds (crushed or powder type) for the nuts. They&#39;re also good without dried fruit."
- "One of my friends who&#39;s expecting a baby soon has been enjoying these as well. I definitely recommend them over oily snacks when you&#39;re hungry."
