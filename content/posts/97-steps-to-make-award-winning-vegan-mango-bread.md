- "Mix all your other ingredients. Fold in your mango paste into dry ingredients. Can you see that banana flavor in my hand? Do not do it. I repeat, do not do it. The flavor is overwhelming and you won’t really taste the mango unless you’re chewing a chunk. Maybe I should have just used a drop. Also I actually used 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil because I wanted moist bread. But it was too much and gave off cake texture rather than bread. So be careful with your oil."
