- "When dough has chilled in the fridge, transfer dough balls to the trays and leave enough room in between each one to allow room for spreading."
- "Bake for 8-11 minutes or until golden brown, when removed from the oven the cookies will be soft and look under-baked so do not remove tray or touch."
- "Let cookies cool for 10-15 minutes on the baking tray and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely, if you wish."
