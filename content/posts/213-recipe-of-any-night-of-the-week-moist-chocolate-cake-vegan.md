Vegan chocolate zucchini cake is the new carrot cake! If you haven&#39;t heard of it yet, don&#39;t worry, you have now, and it&#39;s the new thing! Except that now you have a super rich, ultra moist, fudgy chocolate cake on your hands that you can&#39;t wait to show off! I&#39;ve found that if you make it the day before you want to eat it, it is even better. (it actually seems a little more moist when it is not REALLY fresh).
